#  Medical Image Segmentation â€“ Tumor Detection

This project applies deep learning to segment brain tumors in MRI scans. Two models were explored: a **CNN** (main model) and a **Feedforward Neural Network** (for testing/comparison).

---

## Project Highlights

- Used **TensorFlow** to train CNN on brain MRI data
- Evaluated segmentation using **Dice Coefficient** and **IoU**
- Feedforward model used only as a trial â€” not suited for segmentation
- Built and tested in **Google Colab**

---

## Dataset

- Brain MRI image dataset :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilroxtomar/brain-tumor-segmentation
- Preprocessed with resizing and normalization
- Split into train/val/test sets

---

## Results

| Model | Dice Score | IoU |
|-------|------------|-----|
| CNN   | 0.7019     | 0.4996 |
| FNN   |  0.3478    | 0.4959  |
